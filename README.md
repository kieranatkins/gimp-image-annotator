<h2>Installation</h2>

Follow the guide here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins to find how to install GIMP plug-ins on your system, save the file `image-annotator.py` in GIMP's plug-in folder. 

In GIMP v2.x, the plug-in system relies on deprecated python2. On Windows, a version of python2 is included in the installation of GIMP, so you only need to follow the plug-in installation. On Linux, we recommend using the Flatpak version of GIMP, as it comes with the correct python2 binaries inlcluded. On Linux, the plug-in may need to be made executable with the command `chmod a+x /path/to/image-annotator.py` in order to be seen by GIMP.

<h2>Using the software</h2>

Once installed, navigate to *Toolbox* then *Image Annotator*, add the labels you want, select one, use GIMP's selection tools (e.g. The Fuzzy Select tool - a guide can be found here: https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tools-selection.html) to select an area (use Quick Mask or Shift+Q to quickly see the mask you have created). **Make sure antialisaing and feathering is off, you cannot turn it off for rectangle select however it isn't used**. Once you have your desired selected area, press *Save selected mask*. Repeat until all areas are selected (be aware, if you save a new selection that covers a previous selection it **will** be overwritten). When finished press *Export files & quit*, where *mask* and *annotations* folders will be created in the working directory and each saved there.

<h4>How do I use the data?</h4>

*gimp-image-annotator* saves a binary mask of each annotation, with class of mask stored in the `_annotations.json` file. The `_annotations.json` file is structured as followed


````    JSON
    [{
      "label": "string",
      "id": "int",
      "filename": "string"
    }]
````

The masks can be inputted using most image processing software. For example in `opencv-python` it would be:


````    Python
    import cv2
    mask = cv2.imread(PATH, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
````
